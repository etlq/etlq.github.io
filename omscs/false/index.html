<h1>False accusation of plagiarism is real threat</h2>

It's real systemic risk in OMSCS/OMSA. I know it happened to quite a few students.

</ul>

Ever since I saw these horror stories, I'm so worried about getting falsely flagged. Even if you are innocent, if they say your code matched other student's code by 80%, then you may not have evidence to prove innocence.
<br><br>

Some students check in code with github frequently to have a granular log of progress, while others use an IDE that keeps taking snapshots of code every 10 minutes. That's a good idea, although it doesn't reduce the risk from getting falsely accused, but increases the chance of winning the litigation once false accusation happens.
<br><br>

<h2>Proactive risk mitigating measure</h2>

As a proactive risk mitigating measure, for every coding assignment, I spend substantial time making my code ugly.  Am I paranoid ?  No, it's a legitimate concern because a typical class has 500~1000 students. With homework questions like "load this csv, and fit a linear regression model, and plot the residual distribution" -- if I implement it in a straight forward way in 13 lines of Python code using scikit-learn library functions, I worry my code will almost identically match at least a few other students. It's just probabilistic inevitability.
<br><br>

Also I worry my code may match AI/LLM. So after I finish my implementation, I go ask ChatGPT and compare its result with mine. If they are looking similar, I change my code to protect myself from false accusation. Also I comment every line of my code with extremely verbose descriptions and reference to the library/API documentation, including something super trivial like using numpy.sum().
<br><br>

It's silly and I wish I didn't have to do it. But unless they tell me how else to better protect myself from false accusation, I will continue to do this. 
<br><br>

<h2>Meet MOSS</h2>

I hear from class mates that MOSS is a commonly used tool to measure software similarity. 
<a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/" target="_blank">https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/</a>
<br><br>

Apparently, making variable names unique and adding lots of descriptive comments do not protect you from falsely accused by MOSS because MOSS only looks at the code logic. But hey, I think variable name and comments matter. Because when TAs review code that has been flagged as "high similarity score with other students", if they see a lot of comments explaining every step of the way, with its own variable naming convention, they may be less inclined to believe the code was plagiarized. 
<br><br>

Cheating is terrible, but false accusation of cheating is even worse.
