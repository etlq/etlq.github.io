<h1>My Review of (INFO 4620) TCP/IP and Network Architecture</h1>

<pre>
           Grade: A
      Difficulty: 4/10

 Time commitment: 6 hours/week

<br>

This course is a sibling course to INFO 4610 LAN/WAN technologies. The lecture covers extensive details of the L3/L4 layer architecture, with a special focus on the IP/TCP suite. It turned out to be a good combo to do both LAN/WAN class and this TCP/IP class as they really complement each other. 
<br><br>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

It's the exact same structure as the LAN/WAN course.

<ul>
<li>
<b>8 homework assignments</b> (30%):  All open-book, open-internet, untimed, multiple choice, take-home format. All auto graded. Questions are of moderate difficulty, and mostly directly from the lecture notes. Each homework typically took me a few hours.
</li>

<li>
<b>Exams</b>: One midterm (30%) and one final (30%). Open book, take-home, multiple choice format. There was really no meaningful distinction between weekly homework quizzes versus exams. Both exams were similar to the homework quizzes in terms of the questions and their difficulty.
</li>

<li>
<b>Participation</b> (10%):  You make at least 3 "substantial" posts to the class discussion forum for full participation credit. I usually just shared some interesting articles with my own summary.
</li>

</ul>
<br>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

It's essentially a "textbook dump" course. You digest as much as you can, and keep notes as reference to come back to.
