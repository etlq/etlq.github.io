<h1>My Review of (INFO 2110) C Programming Language Part 1</h1>
<hr>
<br>

<pre>
           Grade: A
      Difficulty: 3/10
          Rating: 6/10
 Time commitment: 6 hours/week
------------------------------

<br>

This course covers all the basics of C: syntax, data types, flow control, IO, functions, so on. The lecture also touches on the underpinning fundamentals like compiler, linker, object code, machine code.
<br><br>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<ul>

<li>
<b>Bi-Weekly coding assignment</b>:  It's a well designed hands-on exercise with a specific focus corresponding to the weekly lectures. It's been many years since I wrote C, so it was refreshing. It usually took me a few hours to complete each homework. Reasonable difficulty. Overall this was fun.
</li>

<li>
<b>Exam</b>: One final exam. Open book, timed, multiple choice format. I thought the exam was hard. They really ask a lot of details on both concepts and syntax. You don't have to write code during the exam, but you will have to read a lot of code, and choose the right answer. For example "what's the returned value of this code ?", "Which function implements XYZ ?"  But overall it's manageable, because it is open-book, so you can get your IDE ready and test out the code snippet. 
</li>

</ul>
<br>


<h2>Thoughts</h2>

The instructor (Bryant Moscon) is chill. Fair grading. The course textbook is "Programming in C" by Stephen Kochan. Honestly, C has so many good free resources online, so you can do without this.
